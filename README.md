# SDL Demo

I'm developing this basic SDL framework for my own use as I explore 
basic c++ game development techniques, libraries, and algorithms.

Some of the assets I've taken from [Lazy Foo](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) .

# Objectives

1. Develop a basic Asset and Scene Management *done*
2. Add Sounds *done*
2. Develop a mine sweeper game. *wip*
